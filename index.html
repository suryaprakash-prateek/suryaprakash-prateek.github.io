                  The population of the world is one of the most interesting data that can be used for analysis. The varied demographics, along with a plethora of metrics and indicators available to analyze every aspect of the numbers present, the dataset opens several avenues to explore and investigate. 
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                With the visualizations that are presented underneath, I am trying to understand if all the statistics used for the study were scaled down to 100. The World, as we know, has 7.56 billion people now, spread over 6 continents (since Antarctica is not permanently resided as a domicile). My attempt here, is to think that the 7.56 billion is scaled down to 100 and the visualization is done on this set of 100 people. 
                
                It is no surprise that Asia is the major contributor to the world population, being home to two of the largest populous countries, China and India. China has a recorded population of 1.388 billion, while India documented 1.34 billion during its last census. Owing to a variety of landscapes, ranging from the cold deserts of Russia, the snowy Himalayas, the fertile lands along the coastline of the Ganges in India and Yarlung Tsangpo in China to the deserts of Mongolia and the Middle East, Asia houses a massive 59% of the world population at the moment. 
                
                Africa takes the second place with a contribution of 16 out of 100. The reasons for the vast disproportion between the size of the continent and the population could be many, but namely it is migration and lack of immunity in the people of the continent due to lack of availability of medical resources. Having remained undiscovered for a major portion of the global history, the Garden of Eden is often an epicenter for deadly epidemics, leading it to remain underdeveloped and in general, having a low life expectancy among its inhabitants. 
                
                Europe and South America have similar numbers, with 10 and 9 people out of 100, while North America, consisting majorly of United States of America, Mexico, Canada and the Latin American nations, contributes with 5 people out of 100. The Australian continent is the least populous continent on the globe with just 1 out of 100 people coming out of the continent. As compared to the 1950s and the 1960s, Australia has seen a significant growth from 0.54 to 1, a rise of almost 100% over 5 decades.

                The working age population of the world, i.e., the ages with 15 and 64 form the lion’s share in the age hierarchy of the globe, with as many as 66 people falling under this category. There are about 9 people who are aged 65 and above and there will be approximately 25 children in a world filled with 100 people. It is a good sign that the ages 15-64 form most of the world population at the moment, indicating that there has been a substantial growth in the longevity of life over the past century where the children formed the majority. 
               
               As many as 31% of the World’s population follows Christianity as their primary religion. Islam takes the second spot with 23 people practicing the religion in a group of 100 people. 16 out of 100 people either do not follow any religion or do not believe in God while 15 people practice Hinduism. There are 7 Buddhists in the world and about 8 people follow religions apart from the ones mentioned here. 
               
               Nutrition, the basic need for survival, has seen a growth over the past decades and currently 63 people in a world of 100 people get adequate nutrition. 21 out of the 100 seemed to overweight while 15 of them undernourished. It is a good indicator that just 1 out of every 100 is starving as compared to the 2.5 in the 1980s, it is certainly a matter of concern owing to the numbers when the numbers are scaled to their original values. 
               
               Thanks to being the most populous country in the world, Chinese (Mandarin) is the widely spoken individual language with 12 speakers as their first language out of 100. Spanish, having its influence, not only in Spain but also a majority of the Latin, Central and Southern American nations, has 6 native speakers in every 100. English stands third with 5 people. Hindi and Arabic have 3 native speakers while there are hundreds of languages spread over a vast population of 60% of the world.

                 It is observed that Europe has the highest number of countries where more than 50 out of 100 people in the country reside in the urban region. The compelling reason for this could be the smaller sizes of the countries, where is some cases such as the Vatican City, Luxemburg, and Monaco, the entire city is defined as one country. The industrial revolution has helped the European countries to have incorporate an urban lifestyle and the development that followed has been an excellent catalyst.

                The following global maps depict the two indicators that have been under check for a very long time are birth rates and death rates. These maps show the number of births and deaths that happen in a year for 100 people of the country in the year 2019. While the global average stands at 1.8 per 100, some countries have as high as 4 and as low as 0.6.

                Similarly, the global death rate is 0.77 per 100 but there are countries varying from 0.2 to 1.6. There are a multitude of reasons for such discrepancies and the governments across the world have been working on providing efficient solutions on either side of the scale.
